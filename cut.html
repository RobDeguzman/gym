  <h1 class="SecondTitle">What is Cutting?</h1>
    <p class="para1">A cut is a period of eating at a calorie deficit
      as a means to lose body fat while maintaining as much muscle mass as possible.
      rom there, instead of adding calories, you’ll subtract a given number of calories each day.
      In other words, you’ll eat fewer calories than you need to maintain your body weight. This will help stimulate fat
      loss. An average active man needs about 2,600 calories per day to maintain weight, whereas an average active woman
      needs around 2,000 calories That said, weight maintenance calorie needs can vary substantially due to body size,
      genetics, and activity level. To stimulate weight loss, a general rule is to consume 500 calories below maintenance.
      While it was traditionally thought this would help you lose approximately 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week, actual weight
      loss differs between people and may change over time
